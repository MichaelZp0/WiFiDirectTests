NetworkContextClient.cpp                        Connect                         82                      Constructor sets m_handshakeHostname and m_handshakePort to connect

                                                ConnectUnderLock                335                     Is going into an HttpHandshakeClient
HttpHandshakeClient                             BeginHandshake                  249
                                                BeginRequest                    392                     Only using the data into the httpRequest, but that is not all



#### Sending the Request to the server ####
                                                BeginRequest                    462                     This is only sending the request. Maybe the http sender is constructed somewhere else
httpsclientcontext.cpp                          BeginRequest                    71                      Only sets m_currentMessage, which should be picked up somewhere



#### Opening the http context including the connection ####
HttpHandshakeClient.cpp                         BeginRequest                    461
httphelpers.cpp                                 CreateContext                   325                     Setting the properties for the channel creation
                                                CreateContext                   329 (333)               Calling create channel with TLS or without. We'll follow the TLS code as we probably want to use TLS.
                                                                                                        Create context is going into a PartsFactory which was created with the following parameters;
                                                                                                            'DCTFactory::GetWellKnownStackDescription(DCTFactory::Stack::RawTlsOverTcp)'
                                                                                                            RawTlsOverTcp resolves to a stack of:
                                                                                                                BeginStack(BASIX_COMPONENT_TYPE_TCP, properties); // dctfactory.cpp - 289
                                                                                                                AddStackLayer(result, BASIX_COMPONENT_TYPE_TLS);  // dctfactory.cpp - 294
                                                                                                            Props is set with DCT_CHANNEL_PROP_NAME_TCP_CONNECT_ADDR to the target host and port
dctfactory.cpp                                  CreateChannel                   52
                                                CreateFilter                    64                      Calls it with WinsockTCP and AsioTCP, but only creates WinsockTCP
factory.h                                       Create                          253                     This is where the WinsockTCP is used to create the TCP thing
winsocktcpdct.cpp                               <Constructor>                   ???                     Just constructs the object, but does not configure it. That is done somewhere else, but that
                                                                                                        does not matter, because we can now breakpoint into that function



#### Configuring the TCP socket ####
winsocktcpdct.cpp                               ConfigureIOSocket               Entry on 375            
                                                                                424                     Create the socket
                                                                                451                     Connect the socket to the address
                                                                                536                     Save the connected socket into m_connectedSocket



#### Use the socket ####
winsockdctbase.cpp                              InternalQueueWrite              195                     Retrieve the saved socket from m_connectedSocket
                                                                                206                     Set the socket of the ioRequest to the connectedSocket
                                                                                235                     Call PostSocketWrite to post a write on the socket
winsocktcpdct.cpp                               PostSocketWrite                 214                     Send out the data
